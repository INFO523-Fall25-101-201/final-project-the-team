A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions

Which NEO candidates are considered hazardous?
Out of hazardous NEO's, which categories of body do they belong to?

## Analysis plan

-   Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids and comets whose orbits cross within 1.3 astronomical units of Earth. Monitoring and classifying these objects is critical for planetary defense as well as gaining insight into the evolution of our solar system. NASA provides a robust public dataset of NEO objects, which include measurements, size, velocity, and orbital parameters.
- This project will utilize machine learning models to classify NEOs as hazardous or non-hazardous based on their metrics and orbital features. We aim to understand what makes an object potentially dangerous and demonstrate how machine learning can support real-world space research.
- Objectives
1. Collect and preprocess NEO data from NASA and or Kaggle
2. Train and evaluate classification models to predict status
3. Identify which features are most influential
4. Create visuals showing metrics and evaluations along with NEO risk patterns and groupings
- Methodology
- Utilize Agile methodology to expand testing parameters continuously to enable us to:
1. Collect and preprocess datasets.
2. Explore features such as size, velocity, and orbit.
3. Conduct ML trials to find the best fit models (Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN) to classify hazardous asteroids or the group
4. 2D/3D visualize orbit paths and distribution of NEOs utilizing Streamlit
